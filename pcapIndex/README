Please Go through the following instructions

1)There are two files in the folder:- PacketIndexer.c and Query_interpreter.c
2)
  a)The program needs a trace file or dump file that contains all the packets. The sample trace file is provided in the folder.
  b)If the user wants to use their own dumpfile then keep that file in the same folder as PacketIndexer.c
  c)Rename the tracefile as trace4
  	
3)Compile and runthe PacketIndexer.c using the following command
	gcc PacketIndexer.c -lpcap
	./a.out
	
4)Compile and run the Query_interpreter.c using the following command
	gcc Query_interpreter.c -lpcap	
	./a.out
	
5)It will ask the user for to give the input attributes using which the packet has to be retreived.
  The input attributes supported and the format of input to be given by the user has been shown below.
  No spaces should be given in the input.


	Input Attributes

Source IP:- srcip
Destination IP:- dstip
Source Port:- srcport
Destination Port:- dstport
Protocol Type:- protocol
AND:- :
OR:- ;


Input Format will be like this:-

	EXAMPLES
1)srcip=10.3.1.6;dstip=23.34.54.56
2)protocol=6		
3)protocol=3:srcport=345

After pressing enter you will get all the list of packets matching your requirements.


REFERENCES/SOURCES
1) Used Basic Compression Library bcl-1.2.0 for RLE compression and RLE uncompression.
2)Used libpcap libraries.
3)Used wireshark for creating the trace file and packet capturing.
